# Harry Potter Fanpage React

## Of the Tale Within This Repository

Three brave souls gathered with a shared purpose, and after much deliberation, they set forth on a quest most curious — a journey they called “Reacting Harry Potter.” Along the way, they encountered challenges, no doubt testing their resolve, but with determination and a touch of wit, they triumphed. Their reward? A magical website, open to all who wish to explore the wonders of Harry Potter's world. No one is turned away, not even Muggles (just having a bit of fun — Muggles are welcome too!).

The goal of this small project was simple: the three sought to hone their skills in the mystical arts of React. Being novices, they embarked on this two-week "journey" to grow their experience and knowledge. By the end, they succeeded — their collective wisdom now richer than before.

## Installation Guide

To unlock even more possibilities and discover new opportunities, you and your companions must embark on this journey yourselves. But before you begin, you must choose your path: Will you take the **easy route** and start with a pre-built project, or dare you take the **hard way** and build it all from scratch? Choose wisely, and may your adventure be filled with wonder and success.

### Option 1: Start a Fresh Project (Build from Scratch on Linux/Ubuntu)

1. **Create a new Vite project**:  
   Start by creating a new Vite project named "Harry-Potter". Open your terminal and run the following command:

   ```bash
   npm create @vite latest
   ```

2. **Navigate into the project directory**:
   Once the project is created, go into the newly created directory:

   ```bash
   cd Harry-Potter
   ```

3. **Install additional dependencies**:
   To recreate the magic found in this repository, install the necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install react-router-dom react-icons
   npm install --save-dev sass
   ```

4. **Start the development server**:
   Once everything is in place, start your development server with:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Option 2: Clone and Install Dependencies (Pre-built Project on Linux/Ubuntu)

1. **Clone the repository**:
   If you'd prefer to skip setting everything up from scratch, simply clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/reacting-harry-potter.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   After cloning, navigate to the project directory and install the necessary npm packages:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**:
   Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the project with:
   (Your project will now be live at http://localhost:3000)
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
